Hybrid Mobile Apps which include this codebase are available in the Google Play Store [Casnic Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=casnic.control&gl=US) and the Apple App Store [CasCon IOS App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cascon/id6458984046).

Instructions for using the application with your devices are available [here](https://gitlab.com/bitsii/CasCon/-/wikis/home).

## Getting Started

First - quick Getting Started! (more about Casnic Control below...)

Follow Getting Started for beApp recursively :-)  https://gitlab.com/bitsii/beApp

Then (from your shell / git shell on Windows)

git clone https://gitlab.com/bitsii/CasCon.git
cd CasCon
./scripts/devprep.sh

you must checkout in the same parent directory that contains beBase and beApp

### Building on desktop

Should work on Linux, Windows, and Mac.  Really only tested on Linux.

from in the project directory (CasCon) command line in a shell (git shell windows) run

../beApp/scripts/bldrunwajv.sh

(runs it too)

that's it

End of Getting Started!
